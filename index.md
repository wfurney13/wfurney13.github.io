This is the personal website of William Furney. The information on this website reflects my personal views & aesthetics. My content on this website is dedicated to the ["public domain"](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/).

The website is generated using Jekyll. You may still encounter some bugs or issues with the site. If you'd like you can report these to me via [email](mailto:mail@wfurney.com).
